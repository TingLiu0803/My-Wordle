## Future Improvements

The project is open to several enhancements that will improve user experience and functionality. Here are some of the planned updates:

1. **Virtual Keyboard**: Implement a virtual keyboard to display the remaining available letters and to indicate the correctness of the current input. This feature will enhance the game interaction directly from the user interface.

2. **Database-Backed Word Bank**: Shift from a static word list to a dynamic SQL database that allows word management. Include functionality to add new words to the bank directly from the frontend, which will make the game more versatile and maintainable.

3. **Enhanced Animations**: Introduce animations for actions like submissions and validations to make the interface more dynamic and engaging for users.

4. **Custom Alert UI**: Upgrade the current alert system to a more sophisticated custom UI that integrates seamlessly with the rest of the app. This update aims to improve user feedback and overall aesthetic appeal.
